So for this project I made a Sierpinski Triangle with recursion which pretty much takes
one triangle and puts smaller ones in with a specific algorithm.  Each level of recursion
should have more triangles in them.  After that I did my own implementation with the 
algorithm which was  a square (apparently called a Sierpinski Carpet).

I spent alot of time on this project and I found it to be a bit tricky.
I also had some help from a few friends on it at some points, but I did do my own work.
