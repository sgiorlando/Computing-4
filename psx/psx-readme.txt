Changes: So the changes I made were 1.) Move the triangle to the bottom of the window so the corners of the triangle are at the bottom corners of the screen. (Also reversed my color roles).
2.) In the original shape I didn't have a recursive function, and I changed it so now it works recursively, I also added a keyboard function so when you press the up and down keys it changes the original shape's recursive depth (It kind of gets weird after 7 on my laptop but 8 works).  I also only used two colors for the square since I originally enjoyed the pattern two colors gave me.

I tried to do some new screenshots but the programs weren't capturing the sierpinski triangle window.

Also an extra note the lint keeps failing in my sierpinski.hpp and original.hpp for the draw function because it's not using a non const reference.  I tried fixing that, but thats also a function given from SFML so I'm not 100% how to work arounf that specific function.
